Simple Hooks Enabling Logging Techniques through an Interactive Experience (SHELTIE)

SHELTIE is comprised of a series of git hooks for collecting productivity
measures as a part of a workflow using git (a version control system). Setup
scripts for configuring a given project for logging are also included, as are
post-processing scripts for consolidating, visualizing, and analyzing the data
collected.

## Overview:

This repo contains a few scripts designed to enable productivity
logging on a git repo. Most are git hooks, which will be automatically
executed by git after a commit is made.

## Dependencies:
  
- `bash` (or similar shell): to execute hooks scripts
- `git`: this repo extends git's functionality
- `git notes`: for storing logs (should come by default with newer versions of git)

## Setup:

- run setup.sh, optionally passing in the path to the main repo setup.sh <main
   repo path> [by default, <main repo path> is one level above where setup.sh
   is stored]

## Usage:

###  Basic Usage 

Once a repo is configured for logging, (see Setup), just commit like normal!
After you finalize your commit message, you will be asked if you would like to
create a commit log. If you answer yes, you will be prompted to answer a few
quick questions about the work you just committed. After answering, your commit
will proceed like normal. Behind the scenes, though, your answers, plus a few
pieces of metadata which are gathered automatically will be stored 
as a git note on your commit.

### Viewing Logs 

You can view the log entries for a given commit using the command git notes
--ref refs/notes/productivity show <commit hash> ommiting <commit hash> will
show the log for the current HEAD.

To see a list of all the log entries, simply run list_notes.sh

### Editing Logs 

Similarly, if you ever need to make changes to your logs, (for instance, if you
entered a value wrong, or there was sensitive information in your commit message)
you can edit the log file for a specific commit using the command
git notes --ref refs/notes/productivity edit <commit hash>
as above, omitting <commit hash> will allow you to edit the log for the
current HEAD.

### Customisation:

You can change the specific areas you will be asked about by editing
the lists at the top of commit-msg, and then rerunning setup.sh to get
the new version of that script into the hooks folder.
